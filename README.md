# BankAppServerSide

This repository holds the server side application for a full stack banking application. The client side code is housed in an adjacent repository (react-capstone-app). This application is written in Java using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security. It houses all the API endpoints and sets up username/password 
checking with sessions controlled by JWTs.

It is set up with REST controllers, a service layer, and a database layer which (in this instance) will build and maintain a MySQL database.
